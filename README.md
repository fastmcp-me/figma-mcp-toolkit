# Figma to React Native MCP

Convert Figma designs to React Native components using Cursor's MCP. This tool extracts components from your Figma designs and generates corresponding React Native components with proper typing and styling.

## Installation

### For Development

Add to your `eas.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-to-code": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["PATH_TO_REPO/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_TOKEN": "your_figma_token",
        "FIGMA_FILE": "your_figma_file_id",
        "PROJECT_DIR": "your_project_directory"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For End Users

Install the MCP server in your Cursor IDE:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @kailashg101/mcp-figma-to-code --client claude --config "{
  \"figmaToken\": \"YOUR_FIGMA_TOKEN\",
  \"figmaFile\": \"YOUR_FIGMA_FILE_ID\",
  \"projectDir\": \"YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY\"
}"
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the following prompts in Cursor:

### Extract All Components

```
using the extract_components mcp tool get all components from figma and generate their corresponding react native components in components folder
```

### Extract Specific Component

```
using the extract_components mcp tool get the [ComponentName] component from figma and generate its corresponding react native component in components folder
```

## Configuration

The config object accepts the following parameters:

```typescript
{
  "figmaToken": string,    // Your Figma access token
  "figmaFile": string,     // Your Figma file ID (from the URL)
  "projectDir": string     // Where to generate the components
}
```

## Features

Current:

- âœ… Extract components from Figma
- âœ… Generate React Native components
- âœ… Maintain component hierarchy
- âœ… Handle component props and types
- âœ… Support nested components

Coming Soon:
